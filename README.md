I implemented a dynamic Sidebar featuring a down arrow icon in orange. When users click on this icon, the navbar activates. Clicking outside the Sidebar will deactivate it, collapsing the menu and maintaining a clean user interface. This functionality ensures intuitive navigation and enhances the overall user experience.
